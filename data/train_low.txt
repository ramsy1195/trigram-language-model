On my point of vew i agree much with specializing in one specific academic subject more than having broad knowledge of many subjects .

When people specialize in one subject they would have deeper understanding of the subject more than people having broad knowledge of many academic subjects , for example a doctor can not have broad knowledge of his field of study that could lead to dangerous and seriouse situations .

Having people specialized in specific subject is useful for improving the subject itself .
A good example would be geologist whos saving his time and efforts to improve new methods of discovering his field of study .

Finally having people with many academic broad know
I agree whit the statement below .
The reason of my affermation is that a person may not , in the actual society , know only a specific subject , because our job employment may change in the future .
Infact our society is more flexible than in past , and then we must to be prepared for all this chenged .

In other , I think that is interesting have a general culture .
For example we should know sometimes about history or science , about maths or philosophy .
Of course we can not know all in absolute .
It is impossible !
