With the rapid growth of our civilization , more and more people start paying attentions to enjoy their lives .
Indeed , with the passing of time , the meaning of life starts to change .
many people realize that health is not equal to wealth .
Moreover , we are standing on the crossroad .
In this turning point , young people enjoy life more than old peolpe do because young people intend to do a varity of sports , experience less pressure from the society , and obtain the tendency to try something new .

It is no doubt that many sports are for young people .
With the upcoming of Beijing olympic 2008 , many sports are introduced at the same time .
My daily experence is a good example of this , I went to ski last month in Vancouver .
When I was standing on the top of the mountain , I rarely see any older people around .
In fact , it is estimated that there are more than 500 unique sports in the world .
Therefore , there are so many sports for young people to attand today ; however , at the same time , there are so few sports for old people to attend .
perhaps the only sport I can think of is Yoga .
To be brief , when doing a sport , young people have more choices than older people do .
