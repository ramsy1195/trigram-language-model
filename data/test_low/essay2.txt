I 'm agree whit this statement .
For example , thinking to the i-pod , a new type of mp3 music , the advertisement that the productors do , is too unreal .
They say that if you have this mp3 , you have more opportunities to be considered by your friends , or by other people , that you have something more that give you what other have n't , give you celebrity or more opportunity with the girls or the boys .
