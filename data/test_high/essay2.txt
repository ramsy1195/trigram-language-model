I agree with the statement , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because if they want to be more successful than they already were , they would try to expand their skills and learn more new things and try to become successful in that , too .
They would risk their time and money , and probably even their profession , in order to gain that knowledge and master that .
